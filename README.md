This is just simple game, in order to practice

The goal is to answer which number is hidding behind the '?' at the middle of the screen

If you put different number, score will decrease by 1, and you will get help message to try higher or lower number

When your number is correct, score will be added to highscore

The goal is to have higher high score than your friends, or then your previous try

I must mention that during developing, I put correct number at first try only once! ðŸ˜Ž

Highest possible score is setted to 25,
The hidden number at the middle will be number between 1 and 50,
however, highest score and numbers between can be easily changed at the top of script.js file
